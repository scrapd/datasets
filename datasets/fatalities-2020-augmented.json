The Dodge left the scene without stopping, which is required by law. \nA witness followed the Durango and was able to provide police with the license plate. The patrol officers on scene contacted the suspected driver of the truck. Detectives later interviewed him at which time he confessed to being the driver at the time of the multi-vehicle crash.
