"""
`scrapd-merger` is a tool to merge 2 ScrAPD data sets together.

The new data will overwrite the old data in case of duplication. If there is no collision, the old data is left intact.

The data sets are expected to be arrays of objects (see test data at the bottom).

Usage examples:

$ python scrapd-merger.py old.json <(cat new.json)
$ cat new.json | python scrapd-merger.py old.json -
